**Introduction**

The web application will allow students to submit their functions and receive a grade based on the execution and comparison with a correct implementation provided by the instructor. Instructors can submit unit tests and a correct implementation of the function, and the framework will execute both the student's and instructor's functions, compare the outputs, and assign appropriate grades.

**Project Framework:** Flask is an open-source web development framework for building web applications in Python.

**Project Features:**
•	The files loaded from UI are placed in two separate folders (upload/students, uploads/Instructor)
•	Python scripts are used for code implementation 
•	Subprocess command is used to run files that provides the result after running the file.
•	Check for any issue in the student code
•	Identified manual test cases for positive and negative scenarios to enhance robustness of the application
